# SexLabProject
This is the second of two pieces of coursework from the end of the HarvardX PH125.9x Data Science for learning data analysis in R. 
It includes an R script which downloads the necessary code and performs all the visualisations/analyses, an RMD file which knits
into a PDF formally explaining all the steps of the project, the dataset itself in CSV format, and the completed PDF for convenience.
